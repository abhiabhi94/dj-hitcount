Additional Settings
===================

There are a few additional settings you can use to customize ``dj-hitcount`` by using them in your ``settings.py`` file.

HITCOUNT_USE_IP
---------------

This tells whether to store the IP address from the request. Defaults to ``True`` for backwards compatibility with ``django-hitcount``.

.. warning ::

    The default value for ``HITCOUNT_USE_IP`` will change to ``False`` in the next major version bump(if a lot of things go well, then in ``v2.0.0``). Explicitly set it to ``True`` to use IP.


HITCOUNT_KEEP_HIT_ACTIVE
------------------------

This is the number of days, weeks, months, hours, etc (using a ``timedelta`` keyword argument), that an ``Hit`` is kept **active**. If a ``Hit`` is **active** a repeat viewing will not be counted.  After the **active** period ends, however, a new ``Hit`` will be recorded. You can decide how long you want this period to last and it is probably a matter of preference.::

    # default value
    HITCOUNT_KEEP_HIT_ACTIVE = { 'days': 7 }

HITCOUNT_HITS_PER_IP_LIMIT
--------------------------

Limit the number of **active** ``Hits`` from a single IP address. 0 means that it is unlimited.::

    # default value
    HITCOUNT_HITS_PER_IP_LIMIT = 0

HITCOUNT_EXCLUDE_USER_GROUP
---------------------------

Exclude ``Hits`` from all users in the specified user groups.  By default, this is set to an empty list (all users counted).  In the example, below, it will exclude all your 'Editors'.::

    # example value, default is empty tuple
    HITCOUNT_EXCLUDE_USER_GROUP = ( 'Editor', )

HITCOUNT_KEEP_HIT_IN_DATABASE
-----------------------------

``Hits`` remain in the database indefinitely unless you run the ``hitcount_cleanup`` management command.  This setting specifies a ``timedelta`` within which to keep/save ``Hits``.  Any ``Hit`` older than the time specified will be removed from the ``Hits`` table.::

    # default value
    HITCOUNT_KEEP_HIT_IN_DATABASE = { 'days': 30 }
